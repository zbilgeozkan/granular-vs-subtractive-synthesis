# 🎧 Granular vs Subtractive Synthesis: Emotional Atmosphere Comparison

This project is part of a digital audio synthesis course assignment. The goal is to recreate the same emotional atmosphere (inspired by artists like Röyksopp) using **two different synthesis techniques**: **granular** and **subtractive**. This repository contains the experiment design, code implementations, sound outputs, analysis, and evaluation results.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To compare the effectiveness of granular and subtractive synthesis methods in creating an emotional, dreamy ambient texture. The same melodic phrase is synthesized using both methods and analyzed both visually and subjectively.

---

## 🧪 Methods

- **Synthesis Methods Used:**
  - Granular Synthesis
  - Subtractive Synthesis

- **Tools & Software:**
  - Ableton Live (Granulator II), Pure Data, Audacity
  - Python (for waveform/spectrogram analysis)

- **Parameters Controlled:**
  - Grain size, waveforms, filter types, reverb, modulation depth
